Freescale ARM Inter Core Communication for Linux - S32V234 (Treerunner)
=======================================================================

The InterCore Communication (ICC) is a subsystem which enables applications to run on 
different (heterogenous) cores in multicore systems, located either on the same target 
or on different targets, running different Operating Systems.
This package contains the S32V234 (Treerunner) port for the Linux part of the 
ICC product.

Currently, ICC enables the communication between applications running on:
- ARM® Cortex®-A53 and ARM® Cortex®-M4 cores on the S32V234 platform
- ARM® Cortex®-A53 core on S32V234 PCIe and ARM® Cortex®-A53 on S32V234 EVB over PCI Express
- ARM® Cortex®-A53 core on S32V234 PCIe and ARM® Cortex®-A57 on LS2080A/LS2085A RDB over PCI
Express, in the BlueBox dual platform system.

It is assumed that this git repo has been cloned to a local directory, e.g. 
'/path/to/icc'.
Prior to being used it needs to be integrated with the Operating Systems running
on each of the targetted cores.

This Linux package provides the Linux source code representing the ICC API implementation,
initialization of the ICC resources (shared memory, interrupts, PCIe communication etc.),
a sample for demonstrating ICC functionality on the Linux side (A5x) and a binary AUTOSAR
application for demonstrating ICC functionality on the AUTOSAR side (M4), which is required
to be loaded on the M4 core prior to loading the Linux modules in the M4 - A53 ICC setup.
 
The API implementation and Linux resource initialization are linked in the ICC module
(ICC_dev*.ko), which also exports the ICC API.
The ICC Sample module (ICC_Sample*.ko) uses the API exported by the ICC module and executes
a loop which exchanges messages with the other end (M4 or another A5x).

ICC module (ICC_dev*.ko) is located in
'/path/to/icc/release/iccs32v234/sample/linux_app/ICC_module',
the Linux ICC Sample module (ICC_Sample*.ko) in 
'/path/to/icc/release/iccs32v234/sample/linux_app/ICC_Sample_module',
and the a binary image for the AUTOSAR ICC pre-built sample application
(icc_sample_asr.bin) in '/path/to/icc/release/iccs32v234/sample/autosar_app'.

For all supported setups, it is assumed that the kernel sources are located in 
'/path/to/kernel/sources' and the kernel build output (binaries and Module.symvers),
if different from kernel sources directory, is located in '/path/to/kernel/build/artifacts'.

Building the ICC modules
------------------------
ICC modules must be built after the kernel is built.
In order to build the ICC modules, the following variables must be set in the Linux
shell:

ARCH=arm64
CROSS_COMPILE=the cross toolchain specific prefix for the build tools (e.g.:
	/path/to/bsp/build_*_release/tmp/sysroots/x86_64-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-fsl-linux/aarch64-fsl-linux-
	for yocto builds or 
	/path/to/toolchain/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu- for stand-alone toolchains)
KERNELDIR=path to the kernel binaries (containing Module.symvers)

ICC is built from the shell by running 'make' from the sources root directory
('/path/to/icc').
The result of the build consists in two modules: 
'/path/to/icc/release/iccs32v234/sample/linux_app/ICC_module/ICC_dev.ko' and 
'/path/to/icc/release/iccs32v234/sample/linux_app/ICC_Sample_module/ICC_Sample.ko'.

1. ICC between M4 and A53 on S32V234
====================================
This setup enables communication between applications running AutoSAR OS on M4, and 
applications running Linux on A53. Supported platforms are S32V234 PCIe and EVB.

Running the AUTOSAR image on M4
-------------------------------
This can be achieved using the latest u-boot build, which has support for this task.
The AUTOSAR sample binary image (icc_sample_asr.bin) must be copied to a FAT
partition on your SD card (e.g. the one containing the kernel image and the dtb,
assumed to be the first partition on the SD card).

From the u-boot prompt, run the following commands:
=> initsram 0x3E809000 0x200000; fatload mmc 0:1 0x3E809000 /icc_sample_asr.bin; startm4 0x3e809200
Then boot the kernel.

Running the ICC demo
--------------------
The output of the demo consists in periodic messages in the console with the number
of executions of the main thread loop and average execution time of the loop.   
If there's something wrong while running the demo, there will be error messages
displayed by the Linux modules.

After starting the M4 image, booting the kernel and inserting the ICC modules,
one could monitor the following:

- output from the modules module:

2. ICC between two A5 cores over PCI Express
============================================

2.1 ICC between two S32V234 platforms (PCIE and EVB) over PCI Express
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This setup enables communication between two Linux applications (kernel modules) running on two
A53 cores physically located on two different S32V234boards, an PCIE and an EVB. The PCIE board
must configured as PCI Express End Point, while the EVB must be configured as PCI Express Root Complex.

Configure S32v234 PCIe as PCI Express End Point
-----------------------------------------------
In the directory where the kernel sources are located, please run the kernel configurator
('make menuconfig').
In the kernel configurator window, enable Freescale S32V234 PCIe Host controller.
For S32V234 EVB (Root Compex), leave the End Point option unchecked:
Bus support -->
PCI host controller drivers -->
[*] Freescale S32V234 PCIeHost controller
[ ] Freescale S32V234 PCIeEP

For S32V234 PCIe (End Point), select everything under PCIe End Point support:
Bus support -->
PCI host controller drivers -->
[*] Freescale S32V234 PCIeHost controller
[*] Freescale S32V234 PCIeEP
[*] Ignore Freescale S32V234 erratum ERR009852
[*] Freescale S32V234 PCIeDW DMA

Exit and save as default configuration, then build the kernel (run 'make' from kernel
source directory).

--------------------------
For S32V234 PCIe:
- In uboot:
	- Make sure you have the variable "ignoreERR009852" set:

2.2 ICC on BlueBox (S32V234 PCIe and LS2080A/LS2085A RDB over PCI Express)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This setup enables communication between the two boards part of the BlueBox, by running
two Linux applications (kernel modules) on the A5x cores physically located on both sides
of the PCI Express.
The S32V234 PCIe board by default is configured as PCI Express End Point, while the LS2
by default is configured as PCI Express Root Complex.
NOTE: In order to have PCI Express End Point support working for ICC, the End Point kernel
configuration must have "Ignore Freescale S32V234 erratum ERR009852" checked.
